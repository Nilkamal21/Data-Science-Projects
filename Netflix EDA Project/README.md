# Netflix EDA Project

This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset. The aim is to analyze and visualize various aspects of the dataset, including IMDb ratings, number of votes, genres, and more.

## Project Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. The analysis focuses on understanding patterns and relationships between different features in the dataset, such as IMDb ratings, genres, and countries where content is available.

## Key Insights

- **IMDb Average Rating Distribution**: The majority of movies and TV shows fall within the 7-8 IMDb rating range, which is typical for popular content.
- **IMDb Number of Votes**: A few highly popular movies and TV shows receive a disproportionate number of votes, skewing the data.
- **Genre Distribution**: Comedy and Drama are the most common genres, while genres like Horror and Fantasy are less common.
- **Available Countries**: Most movies and TV shows are available in a wide range of countries, indicating global appeal.
- **Correlation between IMDb Rating and Number of Votes**: A positive correlation suggests that content with higher votes tends to have higher IMDb ratings.
