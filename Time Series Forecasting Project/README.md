# Time Series Forecasting Project
This project involves time series analysis and forecasting of the Air Passengers dataset. The dataset contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

## Steps Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
- Differenced the data to make it stationary
- Built ARIMA and SARIMA models
- Forecasted future values for the next 12 months

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Science-Portfolio.git
   cd "Data Science Portfolio/Time Series Forecasting Project"

2. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open and run the Time Series Forecasting.ipynb notebook

### Dataset
The dataset used is AirPassengers.csv.
